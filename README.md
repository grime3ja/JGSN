## Jacob Grimes Sports Network

Open project using Sports database and betting APIs. This is for experimental and learning purposes. The APIs are the free versions so they have limits, and one of them has a 100 fetch limit with a charge once you go over that limit.

APIs in use:
- [Football API](https://rapidapi.com/api-sports/api/api-american-football)
- [Betting API?](https://rapidapi.com/arbitrage-bettors1-arbitrage-bettors-default/api/odds-api1)
